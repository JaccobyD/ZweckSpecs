I'M JUST A KID WHO'S FOUR, EACH DAY I GROW SOME MORE, I LIKE EXPLORING, I'M CAILLOU. SO MANY THINGS TO DO, EACH DAY IS SOMETHING NEW, I'LL SHARE THEM WITH YOU, I'M CAILLOU. MY WORLD IS TURNING, CHANGING EACH DAY, WITH MOMMY AND DADDY, I'M FINDING MY WAY. GROWING UP IS NOT SO TOUGH, 'CEPT WHEN I'VE HAD ENOUGH, BUT THERE'S LOTS OF FUN STUFF. I'M CAILLOU, CAILLOU, CAILLOU, I'M CAILLOU. THAT'S ME!
